# House-Price-Prediction-Problem
We were given a dataset that had records of the house prices of 9,761 houses in King County, Washington, US. The house prices are recorded along with some other attributes like - area of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.  We tried to fit a number of regression models and a decision tree model and tested the models on test data of size 2217.
